# Ray Tracing
I study Ray Tracing now and write Ray Tracer by C++.  
This repositry is aimed that I complete Ray Tracer and test many techiques.  
I refference "Ray Tracing from the ground up" so my code is influenced by this book.
# How to Display
There are many methods to display,   
for example output file .bpm, .png, use API DirectX,OpenGL etc.   
I adopt DX library, which is wrapped DirectX.   
If you run my code, you should DX library.
